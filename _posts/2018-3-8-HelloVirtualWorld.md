Hello virtual world!

In this blog, we want to show you how to create virtual cities.

Made from static html pages, this blog will cause no harm to any web server whatsoever, it is guaranteed 100% generated. No command-line tool has been deployed on the computer during the making of. [Github](https://github.com) is able to detect this [Jekyll](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)'s setup from a public [repository](https://github.com/jonmaim/jonmaim.github.io) to automatically generate and host this site. Files are directly modified in the github web interface. Modifications are saved, each time a new commit is added to the git repository.  

What about diagrams? We use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/?mode=github) in github mode. Source `.xml` files and `.png` file export are direclty saved in the Jekyll `./images` directory. However there is a big caveat, it is very easy to loose some work and forget to do an explitcit `File > Save`, which if you do, would invariably lead you to a complete waste of x hours of work. Because if you want to save your work, you have to create a new commit. That is when you learn that draw.io doesn't save your work automatically. So, if running in github mode, draw.io should label it `File > commit`.
