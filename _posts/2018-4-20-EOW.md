title: Rebranding and grant opportunity

It's TGIF and we owe you some news for the week. 

First, Miniluru is no more, say hello to `Luru World`! 
As part of the re-branding, we bought luru.world and luruworld.com domain names. Done, re-branding complete! 
Although we kind of became sentimately attached to Miniluru, ultimately `mini` didn't make sense with the vision of the project which is to simulate `huge` cities online. Miniluru.com is becoming the developer's blog about the `Luru World` creation.

Second, we visited Prof. H S Jamadagni at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore to make a presentation of `Luru World` (was still Miniluru at that time though). Jamadagni is the director of the MSME Center at IISc, which is giving grants to innovative projects from students and startups alike. Each grant is between 15K USD and 25K USD and can be used to buy the hardware and software necessary for the project.

We had a good discussion about the grant criteria, application process and types of projects and ended the meeting with the idea that it was worthwhile for us to apply. Indeed `Luru` is an inovative projects and looks like a good fit to become one of the grantee. The grant would be used to buy VR hardware and subsidize the marketing launch. Work on the application has started.
