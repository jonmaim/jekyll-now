# Rebranding and grant opportunity
It's TGIF and we owe you some news for the week. 

First, Miniluru is no more, say hello to `Luru World`! 
As part of the re-branding, we bought luru.world and luruworld.com domain names. Done, re-branding complete! 
We became sentimately attached to Miniluru but ultimately `mini` doesn't make sense with the vision of the project which is to simulate `huge` cities online.

Second and maybe more important at our stage, we visited Prof. H S Jamadagni at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore to make a presentation of `Luru World` (was still Miniluru at that time). Jamadagni is the director of the MSME Center at IISc.
We also had a good discussion about the grant criteria, application process and types of projects and ended the meeting with the idea that it was worthwhile to apply. Indeed `Luru` is an inovative projects and looks like aa good fit to be a grantee. The grant would allow to buy hardware and software. Work on the application has started.
