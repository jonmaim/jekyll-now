This blog is made of generated static html pages and thus will cause no harm to any web server whatsoever. It is made without installing any tool on my computer. [Github](https://github.com) is able to detect this [Jekyll](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)'s setup from a public [repository](https://github.com/jonmaim/jonmaim.github.io) to automatically generate and host this site. Files are directly modified in the github web interface. Modifications are saved, each time a new commit is added to the git repository.  

What about diagrams? We use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/?mode=github) in github mode. Source `.xml` files and `.png` file export are direclty saved in the Jekyll `./images` directory. However there is a big caveat, it is very easy to loose some work and forget to do an explitcit `File > Save`, which in the case of the github mode, would be better labeled `File > commit`.
