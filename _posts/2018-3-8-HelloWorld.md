I finally found an easy way to publish a blog made of static html pages. It is written directly on [Github](https://github.com) web site by editing and commiting each file in the web interface. 

It is made possible thanks to Github automatically parsing repositories containing a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) configuration. The generated blog is then hosted by Github as well.

You can easily get started with [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

What about diagrams? We use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/?mode=github) in github mode. Source `.xml` and `.png` exports can direclty be saved in the Jekyll `./images` directory.
