title: Parsing and understanding OpenStreetMap data
---

My goal is to be able to obtain map data and then be able to detect the semantic for each zone, e.g., roads, buildings, parcs, etc. I will then be able to tag each area of a neighborhood with tags like walkable / not-walkable, inside / outside.
